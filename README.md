Airline Booking Market Demand Analyzer
This project is a Python web application built with Flask designed to simulate, process, and analyze market demand trends in the airline booking industry. It provides a user-friendly interface to filter data, visualize trends, and generate insights using the Gemini API.

Features
Simulated Data Generation: Generates a dataset of realistic airline booking data for demonstration purposes. This can be extended to integrate with real data sources.

Web App Interface: A simple, intuitive web interface built with HTML and Tailwind CSS for filtering data and displaying results.

Data Processing: Cleans and processes the data to identify popular routes and price trends over time.

Visualization: Uses Chart.js to display price trends visually.

AI-Powered Insights: Integrates with the Gemini API to analyze processed data and provide natural language insights on demand trends, pricing changes, and popular routes.

Setup and Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (or create the files manually):

# If you have a git repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd airline_trends_app

If you're creating files manually, ensure the directory structure matches the outline above.

Create a Python Virtual Environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the airline_trends_app directory (where requirements.txt is located) and install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up Gemini API Key:

Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.

In insights/processor.py, locate the api_key = "" line within the get_gemini_insights function.

Replace "" with your actual Gemini API key.

api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Note: In the Canvas environment, the API key is handled automatically, so you might not need to set it manually there.

Run the Flask Application:
From the airline_trends_app directory, run the app.py file:

python app.py

The application will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open this URL in your web browser.

Usage
Access the Web App: Open your browser and go to the URL where the Flask app is running (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

Apply Filters: Use the "Start Date", "End Date", "Origin City", and "Destination City" input fields to filter the simulated airline booking data.

Generate Insights: Click the "Apply Filters" button. The app will:

Fetch and process the filtered data.

Update the "Price Trends Over Time" chart.

Populate the "Popular Routes" table.

Send a summary of the filtered data to the Gemini API to generate natural language "Market Insights".

Extending the Application
Real Data Integration: Replace the generate_simulated_data function in data/scraper.py with actual data scraping logic or calls to real airline/travel APIs (e.g., Skyscanner API, Amadeus API, if licensed).

More Visualizations: Add more charts (e.g., bar charts for demand by city, pie charts for origin/destination distribution) using Chart.js or other libraries.

Advanced Filtering: Implement more complex filtering options (e.g., by airline, number of passengers).

User Authentication: Add user login/registration if you plan to store user-specific preferences or data.

Database Integration: For persistent storage of scraped or processed data, integrate with a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

Deployment: Deploy the Flask application to a cloud platform (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk) for public access.
